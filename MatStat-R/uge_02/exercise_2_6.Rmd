## R Markdown


Ã˜VELSE 2.6

```{r}
q_3 <- qnorm(0.75)
q_1 <- qnorm(0.25)

iqr <- q_3 - q_1

lower <- q_1 - 1.5 * iqr
upper <- q_3 + 1.5 * iqr
upper
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
